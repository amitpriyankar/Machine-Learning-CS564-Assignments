Result to Part A
-----------------

Accuracy of Individual Classifiers:
Accuracy of Logistic Regression: 0.7291666666666666
Accuracy of Naive Bayes: 0.8333333333333334
Accuracy of Decision Trees: 0.6875


Accuracy of Ensembling Methods:
Accuracy of Majority Voting: 0.7708333333333334
Accuracy of Weighted Voting: 0.7916666666666666

Observation:
-------------
As it can be seen from Result that Ensembling doesn't always give best result, because here, Naive Bayes gives the best accuracy of 83.3% however the ensemble methods give the accuracy of 77% and 79.1%.
Reason for this is that we are also considering results of the classifiers which do not perform that well on the dataset.
